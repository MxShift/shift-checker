## 2.1.0 (2018-05-18)

1. **More stable switching between Master and Slave;**

2. **Syncing module added;**
   * Restore from the last snapshot if a node's height is lower then (blockchain's height - 10), and a node is not syncing;
   * Restore from the last snapshot if a node is syncing, but node's height is lower then the last snapshot's height;
   * Rebuilding from shift_manager if restoring from the last snapshot failed;
      * For blockchain's height it uses explorer's height, but if explorer is unreachable it uses height of a parallel node;

3. **Better view in logs;**
   * Added useful information about nodes;
   * Removed secret key from logs, now it shows only **first - last** words from the secret;

4. **config.php updated;**
   * Removed a "feature" for multiple forging on one node;

5. **Fixed some little bugs in functions;**

6. **Telegram messages split into two modules;**
   * The first is still annoying..
   * The second one is used messaging only for syncing and restoring with a system information;
      * It has a counter for preventing flood and double messaging;
